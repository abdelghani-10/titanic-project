# Titanic Data Preprocessing & Modeling

This project implements a complete data preprocessing and modeling pipeline using the Titanic dataset from Seaborn.  
The goal is to clean the data, engineer new features, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset
- Handle missing values and outliers
- Engineer new features (FamilySize, IsAlone, Title extraction)
- Encode categorical variables
- Scale numerical features
- Train and compare machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Evaluate model performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
